### McDonald's Menu Nutritional Analysis


This repository contains the code and findings from an analysis of the nutritional content of menu items available at McDonald's outlets. The analysis aims to provide insights into the calorie count and nutrition facts of various menu items, identify healthy and less healthy options, and make recommendations for improving the nutritional profile of McDonald's menu.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Nutrical Dataset.csv. It includes nutritional information for 260 menu items, such as calories, fat content, protein, carbohydrates, and daily value percentages for key nutrients.

Project Objectives
Extract meaningful information from the McDonald's menu nutritional dataset.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand nutritional distribution and trends.
Create visualizations to present calorie count and nutrition facts of different menu items.
Identify healthy and less healthy menu options based on nutritional content.
Provide recommendations for improving McDonald's menu nutritional profile.
Contents
analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and repository contents.
Getting Started
To run the analysis and explore the findings:


Analysis Findings
The analysis includes:

Distribution of calorie counts across menu items.
Exploration of nutritional content (fat, protein, carbohydrates) of different items.
Comparison of nutritional characteristics across food categories (burgers, salads, desserts, etc.).
Identification of menu items with the highest and lowest calorie counts.
Average nutritional content analysis by popular menu categories.
Recommendations
Based on the analysis, recommendations are provided on how McDonald's could improve the nutritional profile of their menu, such as introducing healthier options, reducing calorie content in popular items, or enhancing nutritional transparency.
